<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <h2>Purity Kendi Muthitu</h2>
        <p>My name is Purity Kendi Muthitu. I'm a high school mathematics teacher and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Marhematics Education at NC State. I did my masters degree in Mathematics Education at Rutgers University in 2019. I love teaching mathematics especially teaching mathematics using technology. Use of technology while teaching makes the lesson more lively,students are fully engaged and more so, it enhances deeper understanding of the concept being taught.</p>     


    <h2>My Favorite Edtech Tools </h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GeoGebra - </strong> Geogebra is a dynamic mathematics software for all levels of education that brings together geometry, algebra, spreadsheets, graphing, statistics and calculus in a easy to use package. It allows learners to visualize and manupulate hence enhancing a deeper understanding of the concept beign taught. Learners can easily install GeoGebra App using any type of a computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Desmos - </strong>Desmos is an advanced graphing calculator implemented as web application and mobile application. Desmos is quick and free to set up and run simple activities. I love it because it enables instructors to monitor student progress easily.</li>
