        <h3></h3><p>My name is Purity Kendi Muthitu. I'm a high school mathematics teacher and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Marhematics Education at NC State. I did my masters degree in Mathematics Education at Rutgers University in 2019. I love teaching mathematics especially teaching mathematics using technology. Use of technology while teaching makes the lesson more lively,students are fully engaged and more so, it enhances deeper understanding of the concept being taught.</p>     </p>
